1) User logs in and this code is hit -> req.session.userId = user.id

This saves a key value pair to redis:

sess: asdasfwqdwafasf -> {userId: 1}

2) express-session middleware will set cookie on browser (hashed value which represents key in redis store
 (Hashed w/ secret))


3) When a user make a request this cookie is sent to to the server and deciphered

A request is made to redis if the key exists then good to go
